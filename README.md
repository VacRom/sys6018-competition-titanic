Code.R is my full R code used to generate different models. There are some ideas I explored in there (like cross-validation and validation sets but didn't go through with applying them. One reason was because I would need a larger dataset to justify using them).

...tree2.csv is the output related to the final model I used (random forest with 4 predictors).
